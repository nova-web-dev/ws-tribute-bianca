        <p class="p1">Danil Ishutin, also known as &#x201c;Dendi&#x201d; is a professional DotA 2 (Defense of the Ancients &#x2013; info below*) player, who is in a team called Natus Vincere (Na'Vi). Dendi was born on 30 December 1989 (26 years old) in Lviv, Ukraine. He is the 31st highest earning professional gamer in the world, having won approximately $626,883.78 USD in prize money from tournaments. Natus Vincere won the very first International in 2011, which is shown in the documentary Free to Play - which covered his story leading up to and including The International 2011.</p>

        <p class="p1">Dendi is known for his excellent skill in playing a hero in DotA 2, called Pudge (Picture below). This man has been an inspiration to all DotA players around the world, beginners and even professionals. He shows massive dedication to his team (considering he has been the constant player in Natus Vincere while other players have come and gone) and a huge love for the game.</p>

        <p class="p1">Natus Vincere has been under the radar for a while as their roster has changed so many times leading to not-so-good games. Only recently have they been doing extremely well in tournaments. Hence the comment that has been surfacing the internet lately &#x2013; &#x201c;Na&#x2019;Vi is back!&#x201d;</p>
        <p class="text-center">*Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Valve Corporation. Dota 2 is played in matches between two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold in a corner of the playing field. A team wins by destroying the other side's &quot;Ancient&quot; building, located within the opposing stronghold. Each player controls one of 111 playable &quot;Hero&quot; characters that feature unique powers and styles of play. During a match, the player collects gold, items, and experience points for their Hero, while combating Heroes of the opposite team.</p>
